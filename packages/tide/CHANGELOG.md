## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 80e1ee8: Documentation: the packages are live, and releases are compatible. `STYLE_GUIDE.md` gains "The packages are live" — a release does not break an app that works on the one before it; what should go is deprecated and stays; a breaking change is a last resort that needs the maintainer's approval before it is written — and `AGENTS.md` points every agent changing nisc itself to it. The status lines that said "pre-1.0, breaking changes expected" (nova), "API is pre-1.0 and moves" (moss) and "everything else may move" (tide) now say the same. moss's deprecated `installedIntegrations` is no longer described as scheduled for removal: it stays on the type. The style guide's Node floor is corrected to 22.12, what every package's `engines` already says. No code changes.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 45d6731: `load` refuses under the code of what it found: `unknown_effect` for a reflex naming an unregistered effect, `unknown_reflex` for one watching the run of a reflex that is not there, `unguarded_cycle` for an unguarded cycle. Every refusal was reported as `unguarded_cycle`. `details.refusals` lists each reason with its code (`details.errors` is unchanged), and `GraphReport` carries the same list.
