# @niscorp/prism

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b67a125: Documentation only: each package's README, reference and design docs checked against its source and corrected — install lines and peers, signatures, defaults, status codes, licenses (loom, signal: Apache-2.0), and API that existed but was not documented.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 534eb4b: `@niscorp/strata` is a required peer: nova's shell and layout store and Prism's engine import its document-depth limit at load time, and with strata declared optional an app installing nova or Prism without it crashed on import. `check:packages` now follows every built entry's imports and refuses an undeclared one, or an optional peer loaded by a main entry.
