`@niscorp/prism/examples` — the reference as data. `PRISM_EXAMPLES` is 82 examples (`{ id, group, title, description, op?, source, config, expected }`): one for each of the 73 operators, named by the operator, then nine configs of several operators working together. `PRISM_EXAMPLE_GROUPS` names the groups they come in — the reference's own (Core, Arrays, Math, …), in its order. The package's tests evaluate each example against its `expected`, and fail when an operator has no example of its own or has two, so whatever shows them shows what the installed version does. `OP_KEYS`, the grammar's operator names in its own order, is now exported from the main entry. STYLE_GUIDE.md gains "Examples": a change to what a package does changes its examples in the same commit.
